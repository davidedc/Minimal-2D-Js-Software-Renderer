## Session 5: Finalizing the Test Naming Convention

This session details the final phase of the test case analysis project. The primary goal was to move from the comprehensive data analysis (culminating in `test_case_naming_analysis_v18.md`) to a practical, documented, and fully-realized naming convention, and to produce a definitive mapping of all old test files to their new names.

### I. Overview of the Finalization Process

**A. Primary Goal:**
To define and document a final, comprehensive, and systematic naming convention for all high-level test files, and to produce a definitive mapping of old filenames to their new, systematic equivalents.

**B. Key Objectives:**
1.  Incorporate new facets for clipping and context transformations into the analysis.
2.  Resolve all remaining ambiguities and `"unknown"` values from the analysis table by inspecting source code.
3.  Define a clear set of rules for facet order, value abbreviations, and omission to ensure consistent and readable filenames.
4.  Generate a final, machine-readable mapping of every old filename to its new, programmatically-generated name.

**C. Key Technical Concepts & Facets Solidified:**
*   **Facet Refinement:** The `ArcAngle` facet was clarified and renamed to `ArcAngleExtent` to more precisely describe the angular span of an arc, making its relationship with the `Orientation` facet unambiguous.
*   **New Facets (Context):** `ContextTranslation`, `ContextRotation`, and `ContextScaling` were added to capture whether tests manipulate the rendering context's transformation matrix directly.
*   **New Facets (Clipping):** `Clipped on shape`, `Clipped on shape count`, `Clipped on shape arrangement`, and `Clipped on shape size` were added to describe if and how clipping is applied in a test.
*   **Performance Test Strategy for Clipping:** A nuanced strategy was defined and documented to test clipping performance, distinguishing between the cost of *defining* a clip (for visual tests with a `single` drawn shape) and *applying* a clip (for visual tests with `multi*` drawn shapes).
*   **File Formats:** The project used Markdown (`.md`) for human-readable documentation and Tab-Separated Values (`.tsv`) for the final, machine-readable data mapping.

### II. Chronological Summary of Actions

1.  **Feedback and Refinement of Clipping Facets:** The user initially proposed adding four new facets to describe clipping. This system was refined to align with existing facet vocabulary (e.g., expanding possible values for arrangement and size to include `random`, `spread`, `mixed`) and then documented.
2.  **Documentation of Clipping in Performance Tests:** The new strategy for handling clipping in performance tests (per-instance vs. per-frame setup) was documented in `performance-tests-explained.md` and `High-Level-SW-Renderer-Tests-How-To-Add.md`.
3.  **Final Facet Analysis and Resolution:**
    *   A request was made to resolve all `"unknown"` values for `RoundRectRadius`, clarify the arc facets, and add the three new context transformation facets.
    *   A comprehensive analysis of all test files in `tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` and `tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/` was performed.
    *   **Source Code Analysis (`grep`, `read_file`):** It was determined that all five `unknown` `RoundRectRadius` values were, in fact, `randomized`. The analysis also confirmed that only one test file (`rectangles--rotated--multi--...--test.js`) used `ctx.translate` and `ctx.rotate`, while all others used no context transformations.
4.  **Creation of `test_case_naming_analysis_v18.md`:** A new master analysis table was created. This version incorporated the resolved `RoundRectRadius` values, the renamed `ArcAngleExtent` facet, and the three new, fully populated context transformation columns. All relevant documentation (`test_case_naming_analysis_explained.md`, `Work-summary-session-02.md`) was updated to reflect this final analysis structure.
5.  **Defining the Final Naming Convention:**
    *   Based on the complete `v18` analysis, a final convention ("Option 1: Hybrid with Concise Prefixes") was proposed. This convention established a fixed facet order, a comprehensive table of abbreviations, and clear omission rules.
    *   A late-stage refinement was made to use single dashes (`-`) instead of double dashes (`--`) as separators for better readability and command-line compatibility.
6.  **Creation of `new_test_naming_convention.md`:** A new, formal documentation file was written from scratch. It details the intent, principles, facet order, value abbreviations, omission rules, and examples of the new naming convention.
7.  **Creation of `test_case_naming_analysis_v19.tsv`:** The final, definitive mapping file was generated. This machine-readable TSV file contains all the data from the `v18` analysis plus a new `New Test Name` column, which holds the generated filename for every test case, meticulously created according to the rules in `new_test_naming_convention.md`.

### III. Key Files Created/Modified in this Session

*   **`test_case_naming_analysis_v18.md`**: Created as the final, comprehensive analysis table with all facets resolved and populated.
*   **`test_case_naming_analysis_v19.tsv`**: Created as the definitive, machine-readable mapping from old to new test names.
*   **`new_test_naming_convention.md`**: Created to formally document the new naming convention's rules and rationale.
*   **`performance-tests-explained.md`**: Modified to include the performance testing strategy for clipping.
*   **`High-Level-SW-Renderer-Tests-How-To-Add.md`**: Modified to guide developers on implementing clipping in test drawing functions.
*   **`test_case_naming_analysis_explained.md`**: Modified to explain the structure and facets of the final `v18` analysis table.
*   **`Work-summary-session-02.md`**: Modified to log the creation of `v17` and `v18`.

### IV. Summary of Problem Solving and Key Decisions

*   **Problem:** The existing analysis was incomplete, containing ambiguities (`ArcAngle` vs. `Orientation`), unresolved values (`"unknown"` radius), and missing information (context transformations, clipping).
*   **Solution:** A final, deep analysis of all test case source code was performed to gather the missing data and resolve all ambiguities, resulting in the comprehensive `v18` table.
*   **Problem:** A practical naming convention needed to be derived from the exhaustive but complex analysis table.
*   **Solution:** A hybrid convention using prefixes and concise abbreviations was designed. It balances information density with readability and is governed by strict rules for facet order and omission to ensure consistency.
*   **Problem:** The final mapping from old to new names needed to be definitive, verifiable, and machine-readable.
*   **Solution:** The `test_case_naming_analysis_v19.tsv` file was generated to serve as this definitive reference, programmatically applying the convention rules to every test case.

### V. State of Work at End of Session

The multi-session project to analyze and redefine the test naming convention is now complete. A final, systematic convention has been fully defined and documented. A complete mapping from every old test name to its new, algorithmically-generated name has been created and stored in `test_case_naming_analysis_v19.tsv`.

The project is now prepared for the next logical phase: executing the file renaming across the codebase.
