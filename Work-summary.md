# Work Summary


This codebase is a very simple 2D software renderer implemented in JavaScript. It uses basic rendering techniques for lines, rectangles, circles, and arcs. To keep it simple and fast(-ish), it does not support arbitrary paths, nor anti-aliasing. This is OK for my needs, and non-anti-aliased renders make the generated render much more compressible in lossless mode (good for keeping around hundreds of reference test screenshots).

This software renderer uses direct pixel manipulation rather than a path-based approach, making it simpler but also more limited than standard Canvas implementations.

The files Work-summary-session-[n].md contain information about each session.
