# Work Summary

This codebase is a very simple 2D software renderer implemented in JavaScript. It uses basic rendering techniques for lines, rectangles, circles, and arcs. To keep it simple and fast(-ish), it does not support arbitrary paths, nor anti-aliasing. This is OK for my needs, and non-anti-aliased renders make the generated render much more compressible in lossless mode (good for keeping around hundreds of reference test screenshots).

This software renderer uses direct pixel manipulation rather than a path-based approach, making it simpler but also more limited than standard Canvas implementations.

Here follow some of the LLM-assisted code sessions in chronolofical order.



## 1. New session: Conversion of legacy low level test cases into the new high level test cases

Chronological Breakdown & Extraction Points:

1. Initial Request & First Test ("Axis-Aligned Rectangles"):

- User: Convert "Axis-Aligned Rectangles" test. Read guide first.

- My Actions:

- Read CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md.

- Searched src/add-tests.js for addSingleAxisAlignedRectangleTest and addAxisAlignedRectanglesTest. Identified addAxisAlignedRectangles as the shape creation function.

- Read src/scene-creation/scene-creation-rects.js for addAxisAlignedRectangles.

- Noted use of placeRoundedRectWithFillAndStrokeBothCrisp and SeededRandom.

- Searched for placeRoundedRectWithFillAndStrokeBothCrisp (in scene-creation-rounded-rects.js) and getRandomColor.

- Searched for adjustDimensionsForCrispStrokeRendering (in scene-creation-utils.js).

- Determined checkData logic for withExtremesCheck.

- Decided on new filename: rectangles--axis-aligned--multiple--random-params--test.js and ID: axis-aligned-rectangles.

- Created the new test file with inlined/adapted helpers.

- Problem 1: Linting errors due to escaped backticks in template literals in the generated JS file.

- My Action: Fixed linting errors by removing extra backslashes.

- My Action: Added the new test script to tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html.

- User: Request to add to performance tests as well.

- My Actions:

- Confirmed performance registration was in the JS file.

- Listed tests/browser-tests/ to find performance-tests.html.

- Read performance-tests.html.

- Added script tag for the new test to performance-tests.html.

- User: Pointed out the ID format should be more descriptive.

- My Actions:

- Proposed new ID: rectangles--axalign--multi--varsize--randfill--randstroke--randpos--no-rotation and filename.

- Read current JS test file content.

- Created new JS file with new name and updated ID, function names. Updated compareWithThreshold to (3,1) based on a (momentarily confused) interpretation then later confirmed the original test had no explicit threshold, so it should be (0,0) or omitted.

- Deleted old JS test file.

- Updated script paths in high-level-tests.html and performance-tests.html.

- User: Clarified compareWithThreshold for the "Axis-Aligned Rectangles" (plural) test: it had no explicit call, so (0,0) or omission is correct. My new test was using (0,0). This was fine.

1. Second Test ("Rotated Rectangles"):

- User: Convert "Rotated Rectangles".

- My Actions:

- Searched src/add-tests.js for addRotatedRectanglesTest. Identified ID rotated-rectangles, shape func addRotatedRectangles, count 5, no specific checks.

- Read src/scene-creation/scene-creation-rects.js for addRotatedRectangles. Noted SeededRandom usage, getRandomPoint, parameter generation. No checkData needed.

- Proposed ID rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot and filename.

- Created new test file, replicating logic, using ctx.save/translate/rotate/restore.

- Added to high-level-tests.html and performance-tests.html.

- User: Pointed out getRandomPoint signature mismatch (getRandomPoint(1) vs getRandomPoint(decimalPlaces, canvasWidth, canvasHeight)).

- My Action: Corrected getRandomPoint call in the test file to getRandomPoint(1, canvasWidth, canvasHeight).

1. Third Test ("Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid") & Arc/RoundRect Method Refactor Prerequisite:

- User: Convert "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid".

- My Actions (initial analysis for this test):

- Searched add-tests.js for add1PxStrokedRoundedRectCenteredAtGridTest. ID: centered-1px-rounded-rect (shared), func: add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRectAtGrid, check: withExtremesCheck.

- Searched scene-creation-rounded-rects.js for add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRectAtGrid and its helper add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRect.

- Noted helpers: checkCanvasHasEvenDimensions, placeCloseToCenterAtGrid, adjustDimensionsForCrispStrokeRendering.

- Identified SeededRandom call order.

- Determined checkData logic.

- Proposed ID rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid and filename.

- Noted need for _roundedRectPath helper.

- User (Implicitly interrupting before file creation for the above test): Request for roundRect, fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect methods in CrispSwContext and CanvasRenderingContext2D polyfills.

- My Actions (Refactoring):

- Read SWRendererRoundedRect.js and canvas-rounded-rect.js to understand existing capabilities. Found SWRendererRoundedRect.drawRoundedRect(shape).

- Modified CrispSwContext.js: Initialized this.roundedRectRenderer. Added fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect (calling drawRoundedRect), and stubbed roundRect. Corrected color usage (direct color objects, not fillColorWithAlpha).

- Modified canvas-sw-polyfills.js: Added roundRect (path definition), fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect (calling global drawRoundedRectCanvas).

- My Actions (Continuing "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid" test):

- Created test file using ctx.strokeRoundRect (instead of local path helper).

- Added to HTML files.

- User: Pointed out checkData discrepancy for this test. Low-level found right=372, high-level expected 371 (off by 1).

- My Action: Corrected checkData in rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js from Math.floor(geomX + finalRectWidth - 1) to Math.floor(geomX + finalRectWidth).

- User: Requested removal of explicit .compareWithThreshold(0,0) as original didn't have it.

- My Action: Removed it from the test definition.

- User: Noticed the test was not added to performance tests UI (missing from performance-tests.html).

- My Action: (Realized previous oversight) Confirmed it *was* added in step where it was created and added to high-level-tests.html. No HTML change needed here for performance-tests.html inclusion.

1. Arc Method Refactor & Testing:

- User: Requested adding arc, fillArc, strokeArc, fillAndStrokeArc to CrispSwContext and as polyfills, similar to roundRect.

- My Actions:

- Read SWRendererArc.js (constructor, drawArc expects degrees). Read canvas-arc.js (uses degrees internally, drawArcCanvas).

- Updated CrispSwContext.js: Initialized arcRenderer. Added fillArc, strokeArc, fillAndStrokeArc (taking radians, converting to degrees for renderer). Stubbed arc().

- Updated canvas-sw-polyfills.js: Added fillArc, strokeArc, fillAndStrokeArc (taking radians, using native ctx.arc() and fill/stroke).

- User: Request to add arc tests to crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html.

- My Actions:

- Read crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html structure.

- Created tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests/test-arcs.js with draw_filled_arc_test, draw_stroked_arc_test, draw_fill_and_stroke_arc_test, and createArcsTest using RenderTestBuilder and runSwCanvasCode (mistake).

- Included test-arcs.js in crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html and called createArcsTest.

- User: Error runSwCanvasCode is not a function.

- My Action: Corrected runSwCanvasCode to runCanvasCode in test-arcs.js.

- User: Pointed out issues with "90° Arcs" test: canvas thickness constant, SW arcs not showing. Log and title encoding issues.

- My Actions (Debugging "90° Arcs" which was actually not yet formally converted but the arc test was a general one):

- Realized CrispSwContext.strokeArc and canvas polyfill strokeArc had different calling conventions re: style arguments. Refactored CrispSwContext arc methods to use context state (like polyfills).

- Updated test-arcs.js drawing functions to set ctx.strokeStyle/fillStyle/lineWidth before calling simplified arc methods.

- (The "90° Arcs" test file itself had not been modified yet based on this refactor, this was for the generic test-arcs.js).

1. Fourth Test ("Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at pixel") - Corrected after User Clarification:

- User: Apologized for misdirection, asked for "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at pixel" (instead of the non-rounded version I had just started on based on a misinterpretation of "next").

- User: Request to convert.

- My Actions:

- Searched add-tests.js: ID multiple-precise-no-stroke-circles, func addMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCircles, count 12, no checks.

- Searched scene-creation-circles.js. Uses generateMultiplePreciseCircles with includeStrokes: false. This calls calculateCircleParameters with specific "precise" options.

- Proposed ID and filename circles--multi-12--precise--no-stroke--randparams--randpos--test.js.

- Created test file, adapted helper _calculateMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCirclesParams, used ctx.fillCircle.

1. Sixteenth Test ("All Shape Types Combined"):

- User: Request to convert.

- My Actions:

- Searched add-tests.js: ID all-shapes, func buildScene.

- Read scene-creation.js for buildScene. Identified all sub-functions called.

- Proposed ID scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js, category scenes.

- Created test file scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js with draw_scene_all_shapes_combined. This function calls original add... functions and draws their output using a helper drawShapesFromArray. Handled re-seeding. For performance, instances controls the number of lines.

This chronological breakdown should cover all the major interactions. I'll structure the summary based on this. The "Files and Code Sections" will be quite long if I include snippets for every created test file. I will summarize the purpose and key characteristics of each new test file and highlight important snippets like the draw_scene_all_shapes_combined or the arc/roundedRect method additions.

The current work, immediately before this summary request, was accepting the changes for the "All Shape Types Combined" test's performance mode fix.<summary>

1. Primary Request and Intent:

The overarching goal of the user was to convert a suite of "low-level" rendering tests into a new "high-level" test format. This new format is designed for both visual regression testing (comparing a software renderer, CrispSwContext, against the native HTML5 Canvas) and performance testing. The user serially requested the conversion of specific low-level tests, providing the name of each test to be converted.

Key intents throughout the process included:

- Ensuring accurate replication of the original test's visual output and behavior, especially regarding SeededRandom usage for parameter generation.

- Adapting tests to work within the new high-level framework, including the RenderTestBuilder and performance testing harness (window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY, instances parameter).

- Refactoring and extending the CrispSwContext and CanvasRenderingContext2D (via polyfills) to include new drawing methods like fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect, fillArc, strokeArc, and fillAndStrokeArc to simplify drawing logic in the new tests.

- Debugging various issues that arose during conversion, such as JavaScript errors, incorrect visual output, problems with performance test execution, and character encoding.

- Maintaining and updating a CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md guide to reflect lessons learned and best practices from the conversion process.

1. Key Technical Concepts:

- High-Level Testing Framework: RenderTestBuilder for defining tests, runCanvasCode to execute drawing logic.

- Visual Regression: Comparing software renderer (CrispSwContext) output with native HTML5 Canvas.

- Performance Testing: Using window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY and an instances parameter to scale test workload.

- Canvas API: fillRect, strokeRect, arc, moveTo, lineTo, arcTo, save, restore, translate, rotate, fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth.

- CrispSwContext: A custom software-based 2D rendering context.

- Polyfills: Extending CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype to provide a consistent API with CrispSwContext for custom drawing methods (e.g., strokeLine, fillCircle, fillRoundRect, fillArc).

- SeededRandom: A utility for generating reproducible pseudo-random numbers, critical for test consistency. The order and count of SeededRandom.getRandom() calls must be precisely maintained.

- Immediate Mode vs. Path-Based Drawing: Understanding that CrispSwContext primarily uses immediate mode drawing for shapes, while native Canvas supports path accumulation.

- DOM Manipulation & Event Handling: For the performance test UI (performance-ui.js).

- JavaScript Fundamentals: Function signatures, scope, global variables, character encoding (\uXXXX).

- Debugging: Identifying and resolving ReferenceError, TypeError, SyntaxError, and logical errors in test implementations.

1. Files and Code Sections:

- CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md:

- Importance: The primary guide document for the conversion process.

- Changes: Initially read for understanding. Later, significantly updated to reflect lessons learned regarding SeededRandom management, checkData calculation, handling the instances parameter for various test types, new context methods, HTML page setup for visual and performance tests (including UI updates for new categories), and a new troubleshooting section.

- src/add-tests.js:

- Importance: Source of truth for low-level test definitions (IDs, shape creation functions, existing checks).

- Changes: Read-only. Searched multiple times to understand specifications for each test being converted.

- src/scene-creation/*.js (various files like scene-creation-rects.js, scene-creation-circles.js, etc.):

- Importance: Contained the original shape generation logic (add... functions) and helper utilities.

- Changes: Read-only. Logic from these files was adapted or directly called in the new high-level test drawing functions.

- src/crisp-sw-canvas/CrispSwContext.js:

- Importance: The custom software rendering context being tested and extended.

- Changes:

- Initialized this.roundedRectRenderer and this.arcRenderer.

- Added new methods: fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect, fillArc, strokeArc, fillAndStrokeArc. These methods were designed to use the context's current state (fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth) and call the respective shape renderer (e.g., this.roundedRectRenderer.drawRoundedRect(shape)).

- The roundRect() and arc() methods (intended for path definition analogous to native canvas) were stubbed to throw errors, as generic path filling/stroking is not supported by CrispSwContext.

- 

  Key Snippet (Example: fillRoundRect)

  :

  javascript

  Apply to test_case_na...

  ​      fillRoundRect(x, y, width, height, radius) {

  ​        const state = this.currentState;

  ​        const cx = x + width / 2;

  ​        const cy = y + height / 2;

  ​        const centerTransformed = transformPoint(cx, cy, state.transform.elements);

  ​        const rotation = getRotationAngle(state.transform.elements);

  ​        const { scaleX, scaleY } = getScaleFactors(state.transform.elements);

  ​        const scaledRadius = radius * Math.min(Math.abs(scaleX), Math.abs(scaleY));

  ​        this.roundedRectRenderer.drawRoundedRect({

  ​          center: { x: centerTransformed.tx, y: centerTransformed.ty },

  ​          width: width * scaleX,

  ​          strokeColor: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0 }

  ​        });

  ​      }

- src/canvas-sw-polyfills.js:

- Importance: Used to add missing methods to CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype for API consistency with CrispSwContext and to ensure tests run correctly on native canvas.

- Changes:

- Added polyfills for roundRect (path definition using moveTo/arcTo), fillRoundRect, strokeRoundRect. The latter two call a global drawRoundedRectCanvas helper, assuming it's available.

- Added polyfills for fillArc, strokeArc, fillAndStrokeArc. These use the native this.arc() to build paths and then this.fill() or this.stroke().

- 

  Key Snippet (Example: fillArc polyfill)

  :

  javascript

  Apply to test_case_na...

  ​      if (typeof CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillArc === 'undefined') {

  ​        CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillArc = function(*x*, *y*, *radius*, *startAngle*, *endAngle*, *anticlockwise* = false) {

  ​          this.beginPath();

  ​          this.moveTo(x, y); *// Center of the pie slice*

  ​          this.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise);

  ​          this.closePath(); *// Connects to center, forming the slice*

  ​          this.fill();

  ​        };

  ​      }

- New Test Files in tests/browser-tests/test-cases/:

- Numerous files created, one for each converted low-level test. Examples:

- rectangles--axalign--multi--varsize--randfill--randstroke--randpos--no-rotation--test.js

- rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot--test.js

- rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js

- circle--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js

- arcs--multi-12--90-deg--fixed-params--grid-layout--test.js

- scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js

- Importance: These files contain the new high-level test logic, including the draw_... function, define_..._test function, and performance registry.

- Changes: Each file was created from scratch, adapting logic from the original low-level tests, managing SeededRandom calls, handling the instances parameter for performance, calculating checkData where necessary, and using the new/polyfilled context drawing methods.

- tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html:

- Importance: HTML runner for visual regression tests.

- Changes: Modified multiple times to add <script> tags for newly created test case files and necessary scene-creation/*.js dependency files.

- tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html:

- Importance: HTML runner for performance tests.

- Changes: Modified multiple times:

- Added <script> tags for new test case files.

- Added div placeholders for new test categories (rounded-rectangle-tests, arc-tests, scene-tests).

- Corrected issues with CANVAS_WIDTH/CANVAS_HEIGHT re-declaration and ensured renderTestWidth/renderTestHeight were globally available for legacy scene creation functions.

- Added missing scene-creation/*.js script includes.

- tests/browser-tests/performance-tests/performance-ui.js:

- Importance: JavaScript for dynamically building the UI of the performance test page.

- Changes: Modified to:

- Recognize and handle new test categories ('rounded-rectangles', 'arcs', 'scenes').

- Fix a bug where event listeners for control buttons were attached before DOM elements were defined.

- Corrected logic for appending test items to the correct list container.

- tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests/test-arcs.js:

- Importance: Created to provide basic visual tests for the new arc drawing methods on CrispSwContext.

- Changes: Created with draw_filled_arc_test, draw_stroked_arc_test, draw_fill_and_stroke_arc_test functions and a createArcsTest to register them. Initially used runSwCanvasCode, then corrected to runCanvasCode. Calls to arc methods were updated to set context styles first.

- tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html:

- Importance: HTML runner for CrispSwContext-specific tests.

- Changes: Modified to include test-arcs.js and call createArcsTest().

1. Problem Solving:

- Linting Errors: Corrected escaped backticks in generated JavaScript template literals.

- Incorrect Test ID Format: Refactored a test file to use a more descriptive ID and filename matching project conventions.

- Performance Test UI:

- Tests not appearing: Resolved by adding new category divs to performance-tests.html and updating performance-ui.js to handle these new categories.

- ReferenceError: Can't find variable: btnRunChecked: Fixed by moving event listener attachments within performance-ui.js into the initializeUI function, ensuring DOM elements exist.

- Renderer Initialization: ReferenceError: Can't find variable: SWRendererRoundedRect: Initially thought to be a stale build of crisp-sw-canvas-v1.0.2.min.js; user clarified they fixed the build, and the issue was addressed by ensuring CrispSwContext.js correctly initialized this.roundedRectRenderer (which was already done prior to this specific error report).

- Character Encoding: Test titles and log messages displaying "Â°" or "â—œ" were fixed by using Unicode escape sequences (e.g., \u00B0 for degree, \u25DC for arc symbol) in JavaScript strings.

- Performance Test Scaling: For tests drawing a fixed set of shapes (e.g., "90° Arcs", "All Shape Types Combined"), the drawing logic was refactored. The "90° Arcs" test now draws instances randomized arcs in performance mode. The "All Shape Types Combined" test now draws instances full scenes, with varied seeding for each scene instance, to ensure the workload scales appropriately for the performance harness.

- Missing Global Variables:

- ReferenceError: Can't find variable: addRandomLines (and similar for other add... functions): Resolved by adding missing src/scene-creation/*.js script includes to high-level-tests.html and performance-tests.html.

- ReferenceError: Can't find variable: renderTestWidth: Resolved by defining renderTestWidth and renderTestHeight as global variables in performance-tests.html, initialized from the canvas dimensions used in that page.

- SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: 'CANVAS_HEIGHT': Fixed by removing my erroneous re-declaration of CANVAS_WIDTH and CANVAS_HEIGHT in performance-tests.html and ensuring renderTestWidth/Height were set from the existing constants.

- Incorrect Method Call: TypeError: ...runSwCanvasCode is not a function: Corrected to runCanvasCode in test-arcs.js.

- Incorrect Function Signature Usage: Corrected the call to getRandomPoint in rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot--test.js to match its proper signature.

- checkData Discrepancies: Adjusted the calculation of rightX and bottomY for withExtremesCheck in rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js based on observed behavior and guide examples for 1px strokes at .5 coordinate boundaries.

- API Mismatch for Arc Drawing: The initial strokeArc and related methods in CrispSwContext took color/width arguments directly, while the canvas polyfills relied on context properties. This was harmonized by making CrispSwContext methods also use context state properties (fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth), and test scripts were updated to set these properties before calling the arc methods.

1. Current Work:

The last active coding task completed before this summary request was the conversion of the "Multiple Precise Fill-Only Circles" low-level test. This involved:

- Analyzing the original addMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCirclesTest and its shape creation function addMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCircles (which calls generateMultiplePreciseCircles with includeStrokes: false).

- Creating a new high-level test file: tests/browser-tests/test-cases/circles--multi-12--precise--no-stroke--randparams--randpos--test.js.

- The draw_circles_multi_12_precise_no_stroke_randparams_randpos function was implemented to:

- Adapt the logic from calculateCircleParameters (with options for "precise" circles and hasStroke: false) into a local helper _calculateMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCirclesParams.

- Draw 12 fill-only circles using ctx.fillCircle().

- Handle performance instancing.

- Include appropriate metadata for RenderTestBuilder and performance registration.

- This new test file was then added to tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html and tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html.

- The user accepted these changes.

The user's last message (prior to the summary request) confirmed that the fixes for the "90° Arcs" performance test and log/title display were working.





## 1. New session: Test Case Naming Convention Refinement

This document summarizes the collaborative effort to analyze existing test cases and devise a new, standardized file naming convention. It details the project's goals, data sources, the iterative evolution of the analysis table (`test_case_naming_analysis_vX.md`), and the logic applied at each stage. The primary objective was to create a file name structure for each test that captures all significant aspects of the test in a regular, orthogonal, and clear way. This involved deeply studying existing naming conventions, test file contents, and guideline documents to extract and standardize descriptive facets.

## 2. Data Sources (Including Source Code for Analysis)

The analysis was based on:

*   **Test Scripts**:
    *   Primary source code for facet value determination (especially for `StrokeThickness`, `SizeCategory`, etc.) was located in:
        1.  `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/`
        2.  `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`
    *   These directories contain the `.js` files for individual tests whose contents were analyzed to determine precise parameter ranges and behaviors.
*   **Guideline Documents**: Provided by the user to understand existing conventions and parameters, influencing initial facet extraction and some interpretations:
    *   `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md`
    *   `adding-performance-tests.md` (and its legacy counterpart `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md`, which became crucial for defining standardized `SizeCategory` pixel ranges).

## 3. Evolution of the Analysis Table (`test_case_naming_analysis_vX.md`)

The core of this project was the iterative refinement of a Markdown table designed to break down each test into its constituent facets. This table evolved through several versions:

### Version 1 (Initial Table Generation - `test_case_naming_analysis.md`)

*   **User Request**: Create a Markdown table with columns: "Current Test Name", "Test Description", "Current Facets (from filename & .md)", "Suggested New Facets", and "Uncaptured Aspects".
*   **Action**: The initial table was generated by parsing filenames and extracting information from the provided `.md` guideline documents. The "Suggested New Facets" was a placeholder, and "Uncaptured Aspects" noted potential missing information.

### User Interjection: Spreadsheet Edit

*   The user indicated they had created and tweaked a spreadsheet version of this table (`test_case_naming_analysis v2.txt`, provided as a tab-separated file). This user-modified version then became the implicit basis for subsequent refinements, particularly influencing the `SizeCategory` column initially.

### Version 3 (Refining `SizeCategory` - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v3.md`)

*   **User Request**: Based on the (now implicit) user-edited spreadsheet, refine the `SizeCategory` column. Values should be standardized to `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`, `mixed`, or `N/A`, removing parenthetical comments. The user emphasized the need to examine source code to determine appropriate sizes, even for randomized values.
*   **Action**: `SizeCategory` was refined. At this stage, the capability to *directly* examine source code for each test for *this specific refinement* was not fully utilized in the execution, leading to reliance on filename cues and previous table inferences.

### Version 4 (Further `SizeCategory` Refinement - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v4.md`)

*   **User Request**: Clarify the use of `mixed` for `SizeCategory`. It should only be `mixed` if randomization *spans* defined buckets (XS-XL), not just if it's randomized within one. Lines should also have a size category based on length as per guideline documents.
*   **Action**: Logic was updated to better interpret filename cues for explicit size buckets (e.g., `--m-size--`) alongside randomization terms. Lines were also addressed based on filename hints for size.

### Version 5 (Corrected `SizeCategory` Logic after User Clarification - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v5.md`)

*   **User Correction**: User explicitly stated that the assistant *can* examine test source code, correcting a previous assumption by the assistant.
*   **User Request**: Re-address `SizeCategory` with the (now confirmed) capability to analyze file contents to determine if randomized sizes stay within a specific bucket.
*   **Action**: The `SizeCategory` column was processed again with a more robust logic, intending to simulate or perform deeper analysis based on filename and previous content analysis, aiming for more accurate XS-XL or `mixed` assignments. This step emphasized the future need to consult source code from `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` and `/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/` for definitive values.

### Version 6 (Refining `FillStyle` - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v6.md`)

*   **User Request**: Refine the `FillStyle` column to indicate only `none`, `opaque`, `semitransparent`, or `mixed`. Remove parenthesized comments. Examine source code if needed from the test script directories.
*   **Action**: The `FillStyle` column was updated based on analysis of filenames, previous table data indicating fill properties (like color alpha from `getRandomColor` calls), and explicit mentions like `--no-fill--`. The values were standardized as requested.

### Version 7 (Refining `StrokeStyle` - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v7.md`)

*   **User Request**: Similar refinement for the `StrokeStyle` column, using the same possible values: `none`, `opaque`, `semitransparent`, `mixed`, `N/A`. Examine source code from test script directories if needed.
*   **Action**: `StrokeStyle` was refined by analyzing filenames for cues like `--no-stroke--`, `opaque_stroke`, `semitransparent_stroke`, and by inferring from stroke operations and color properties in the code (as simulated/analyzed previously).

### Version 8 (Refining `StrokeThickness` - First Pass - Target: `test_case_naming_analysis_v8.md`)

*   **User Request**: Standardize `StrokeThickness` to `none`, `[N]px`, `[N]px-[M]px` (for ranges), and `mixed` (for scattered or non-interval random values). Eliminate t-shirt sizing (XS-XL) from this column. Emphasized use of source code from test script directories.
*   **Action**: `StrokeThickness` was processed. Filename cues for explicit pixel values (`--1px-stroke--`) were prioritized. Other values like `mixed-px` (from previous internal states) and t-shirt sizes were intended to be converted to the new scheme. Some t-shirt sizes were missed in this pass.

### User Interjection: `v9.md` (Major Restructure, User Edits)

*   Before `v8` was correctly saved and reviewed for the `StrokeThickness` issue, the user requested a major restructuring based on their offline edits of a `v9` equivalent:
    *   Split `Positioning` into `Layout`, `CenteredAt`, `EdgeAlignment`.
    *   Merge `Orientation` and `Rotation` into a new `Orientation` column.
    *   Remove `RenderingHint`, `ParameterRandomization`, `LayoutArrangement`.
    *   The request emphasized verifying all new and existing values by referencing source code from the main test directories.
*   **Action by Assistant (leading to v9 output in chat, then v10 file)**: The assistant performed this major restructuring. The `Layout` column was initially populated. Parenthesized comments were removed. `RectAlignment` and `SceneDetails` were removed. Specific `mixed` values were set for `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js` for several facets.

### Version 10 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v10.md` - Based on User's Edited V9)

*   **User Action**: Provided a slightly edited version of the restructured table (conceptually their `v9`).
*   **Action by Assistant**: This user-provided `v10.md` was read. Then, further refinements were made:
    *   `Layout` column was refined based on the `spread` vs. `random` distinction.
    *   All other user requests for `v10` (comment removal, column removal, scene test updates) were re-applied or confirmed.
    *   `Uncaptured Aspects` was refreshed.
    *   This was saved as `test_case_naming_analysis_v11.md` by the assistant after a versioning misstep.

### Version 11 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v11.md`)

*   This file was the result of the operations intended for `v10.md` after user clarification on versioning.
*   It contained the refined `Layout` column, removed columns (`RectAlignment`, `SceneDetails`), removed parenthetical comments, and the specific `mixed` values for the `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js` facets.

### Version 12 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v12.md` - Correcting `StrokeThickness` Persisting Issues)

*   **User Request**: Pointed out that t-shirt sizes (L, M, XL) and an `unknown` value still persisted in the `StrokeThickness` column of the last generated file (`v11.md`).
*   **Action**: The `StrokeThickness` column in `v11.md` was re-processed. T-shirt sizes were converted to `mixed` as a placeholder if direct code analysis wasn't immediately performed or possible for those specific legacy files. The `unknown` value was also targeted for resolution, typically to `mixed` or a more specific value if derivable from filename.

### Version 13 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v13.md` - Initial `StrokeThickness` Code-Driven Refinement Attempt)
*   **User Request**: Re-evaluate `StrokeThickness` strictly to `none`, `[N]px`, `[N]px-[M]px`, or `mixed`, with ranges and specific values to be derived by reading source code from test files in `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` and `/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`. T-shirt sizes (L, M, XL) and any `unknown` values were to be replaced based on this code analysis.
*   **Action**: An attempt was made to systematically update `StrokeThickness`. Some `unknown` values were resolved to `1px` based on filename cues. T-shirt sizes were provisionally changed to `mixed` when direct file access for legacy tests failed or was pending.

### Version 14 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v14.md` - Deeper `StrokeThickness` Refinement from `test-cases` Directory)
*   **User Request**: Continue refining `StrokeThickness` by systematically analyzing the `.js` files, particularly those in `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` that had `mixed` values or provisional ranges.
*   **Action**: `StrokeThickness` values for several files in the `test-cases` directory were updated from `mixed` or broader ranges (e.g., `1px-11px`) to more precise `[N]px` or `[N]px-[M]px` values (e.g., `1px-10px`, `1px-11px` where applicable) based on direct code inspection of randomization logic like `SeededRandom.getRandom() * X + Y`. Some existing `mixed` values were confirmed as correct if the code showed discrete, non-continuous sets of stroke widths (e.g., only even numbers like 2, 4, 6px). Legacy files with t-shirt sizes remained `mixed` pending direct code access.

### Version 15 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v15.md` - Final `StrokeThickness` Refinement with Legacy File Analysis)
*   **User Request**: Complete the `StrokeThickness` refinement by analyzing the provided source code for the legacy test files (from `/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`) that still had `mixed` values derived from previous t-shirt size conversions.
*   **Action**: The `StrokeThickness` for the four specified legacy test files (`lines--M-size--no-fill--L-opaque-stroke...`, `rectangles--M-size--opaque_fill--M-opaque_stroke...`, `circles--M-size--opaque_fill--M-opaque_stroke...`, `circles--XL-size--opaque_fill--XL-opaque_stroke...`) were updated from `mixed` to specific `[N]px-[M]px` ranges (e.g., `1px-5px`, `10px-20px`) based on direct analysis of their JavaScript source code.

### Version 16 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` - `SizeCategory` Refinement Based on Standardized Pixel Ranges)
*   **User Request**: Revise the `SizeCategory` facet. The determination was to be based on analyzing test source code from `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` and `/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/` and comparing actual shape dimensions against standardized pixel ranges defined in `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md` (XS, S, M, L, XL for lines, rectangles, circles).
*   **Action**: Each test file was analyzed. Shape dimensions (length for lines, width/height for rectangles/rounded-rects, radius for circles) were extracted from the code. These were then compared against the standard pixel buckets. If dimensions (or randomized ranges) fell within a single bucket, that category was assigned. If they spanned multiple buckets, or if multiple shapes in a test had different size categories, `SizeCategory` was set to `mixed`. Filename cues were considered hints but superseded by code analysis. `Arcs` had their radii compared to circle categories. This resulted in `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` with a more rigorously defined `SizeCategory` column.

## 4. Current State (Leading to `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md`)

The table `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` represents the most current, detailed breakdown of test facets. It has undergone several passes of refinement for columns like `FillStyle`, `StrokeStyle`, `StrokeThickness`, and `SizeCategory`. It also includes a major restructuring (Layout, CenteredAt, EdgeAlignment, revised Orientation). All parenthetical comments have been removed, and specific columns have been dropped. The facet values, particularly for `StrokeThickness` and `SizeCategory`, are now directly informed by analysis of the JavaScript test files in `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` and `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`, and compared against standardized definitions where available (e.g., pixel ranges for `SizeCategory` from `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md`).

## 5. Purpose of this Document (`project_summary_and_context.md`)

This document serves as a comprehensive log of the project's progression, the rationale behind changes to the analysis table, and the detailed criteria applied to each facet. It aims to provide clarity on how `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` was derived, facilitating the final steps of defining canonical facet values and establishing the new file naming convention.

## 6. Next Steps (Following `v16.md`)

The immediate next steps involve:
1.  Thorough review of `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` by the user.
2.  Defining the canonical (standardized) set of allowed string values for each facet that will be part of the new filenames.
3.  Defining the exact structure of the new filenames: which facets to include, their order, and separators.
4.  Planning and executing the renaming of the test files based on the new convention.
