## Session 1: Legacy Test Case Conversion to High-Level Format

This session focused on converting older, "low-level" rendering tests into a new "high-level" test format. The new format supports visual regression testing (comparing a custom software renderer, `CrispSwContext`, against the native HTML5 Canvas) and performance testing.

### I. Overview of Conversion Process

**A. Primary Goal:**
The main objective was to systematically convert a suite of low-level tests, as requested by the user, ensuring accurate replication of visual output and behavior.

**B. Key Objectives:**
*   **Visual and Behavioral Accuracy:** Precisely replicate original test visuals, especially concerning `SeededRandom` usage for parameter generation.
*   **Framework Adaptation:** Integrate tests into the new high-level framework, utilizing `RenderTestBuilder` and the performance testing harness ( `window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY`, `instances` parameter).
*   **API Extension:** Refactor and extend `CrispSwContext` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D` (via polyfills) with new drawing methods (e.g., `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect`, `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc`) to simplify test logic.
*   **Debugging:** Resolve JavaScript errors, visual discrepancies, performance test issues, and character encoding problems.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain and update `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md` with lessons learned and best practices.

**C. Key Technical Concepts:**
*   **High-Level Testing Framework:** `RenderTestBuilder` for test definition, `runCanvasCode` for drawing logic execution.
*   **Visual Regression:** Comparison of `CrispSwContext` output against native HTML5 Canvas.
*   **Performance Testing:** Scalable workload testing using `window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY` and an `instances` parameter.
*   **Canvas API Primitives:** `fillRect`, `strokeRect`, `arc`, `moveTo`, `lineTo`, `arcTo`, `save`, `restore`, `translate`, `rotate`, `fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `lineWidth`.
*   **`CrispSwContext`:** The custom software-based 2D rendering context under test.
*   **Polyfills:** Extensions to `CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype` for API consistency with `CrispSwContext` (e.g., `strokeLine`, `fillCircle`, `fillRoundRect`, `fillArc`).
*   **`SeededRandom`:** Utility for reproducible pseudo-random number generation, vital for test consistency. Precise call order and count are critical.
*   **Drawing Modes:** Understanding of `CrispSwContext`'s primarily immediate mode drawing versus native Canvas's path accumulation.
*   **DOM Manipulation & Event Handling:** Utilized for the performance test UI (`performance-ui.js`).
*   **JavaScript Fundamentals:** Function signatures, scope, global variables, character encoding (e.g., `\uXXXX`).
*   **Error Resolution:** Debugging `ReferenceError`, `TypeError`, `SyntaxError`, and logical errors.

### II. Chronological Conversion of Test Cases

The following tests were converted in sequence. Each entry outlines the original request and the corresponding actions.

**1. Test: "Axis-Aligned Rectangles"**
    *   **User Request:** Convert "Axis-Aligned Rectangles" test, referencing `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md`.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Read `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md`.
        *   Searched `src/add-tests.js` for `addSingleAxisAlignedRectangleTest` and `addAxisAlignedRectanglesTest`; identified `addAxisAlignedRectangles` as the shape creation function.
        *   Read `src/scene-creation/scene-creation-rects.js` for `addAxisAlignedRectangles`.
        *   Noted usage of `placeRoundedRectWithFillAndStrokeBothCrisp` and `SeededRandom`.
        *   Searched for `placeRoundedRectWithFillAndStrokeBothCrisp` (in `scene-creation-rounded-rects.js`) and `getRandomColor`.
        *   Searched for `adjustDimensionsForCrispStrokeRendering` (in `scene-creation-utils.js`).
        *   Determined `checkData` logic for `withExtremesCheck`.
        *   Proposed new filename: `rectangles--axis-aligned--multiple--random-params--test.js` and ID: `axis-aligned-rectangles`.
        *   Created the new test file with inlined/adapted helper functions.
        *   **Problem:** Linting errors (escaped backticks in template literals).
        *   **Fix:** Removed extra backslashes in the generated JS file.
        *   Added the new test script to `tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html`.
    *   **User Request:** Add to performance tests.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Confirmed performance registration was present in the JS file.
        *   Listed `tests/browser-tests/` to locate `performance-tests.html`.
        *   Read `performance-tests.html`.
        *   Added a script tag for the new test to `performance-tests.html`.
    *   **User Feedback:** Test ID format needed to be more descriptive.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Proposed new ID: `rectangles--axalign--multi--varsize--randfill--randstroke--randpos--no-rotation` and a corresponding filename.
        *   Read the content of the current JS test file.
        *   Created a new JS file with the new name, updated ID, and function names.
        *   Initially set `compareWithThreshold` to `(3,1)` (misinterpretation), then confirmed the original test had no explicit threshold, so `(0,0)` or omission was correct. The new test used `(0,0)`.
        *   Deleted the old JS test file.
        *   Updated script paths in `high-level-tests.html` and `performance-tests.html`.
    *   **User Clarification:** For "Axis-Aligned Rectangles" (plural), no explicit `compareWithThreshold` call meant `(0,0)` or omission was correct. The new test's `(0,0)` was acceptable.

**2. Test: "Rotated Rectangles"**
    *   **User Request:** Convert "Rotated Rectangles".
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Searched `src/add-tests.js` for `addRotatedRectanglesTest`. Identified ID `rotated-rectangles`, shape function `addRotatedRectangles`, count 5, no specific checks.
        *   Read `src/scene-creation/scene-creation-rects.js` for `addRotatedRectangles`. Noted `SeededRandom` usage, `getRandomPoint`, and parameter generation. No `checkData` needed.
        *   Proposed ID `rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot` and filename.
        *   Created a new test file, replicating logic, using `ctx.save/translate/rotate/restore`.
        *   Added to `high-level-tests.html` and `performance-tests.html`.
    *   **User Feedback:** `getRandomPoint` signature mismatch (`getRandomPoint(1)` vs. `getRandomPoint(decimalPlaces, canvasWidth, canvasHeight)`).
    *   **Action:** Corrected `getRandomPoint` call in the test file to `getRandomPoint(1, canvasWidth, canvasHeight)`.

**3. Test: "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid" & Prerequisite Arc/RoundRect Method Refactor**
    *   **User Request:** Convert "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid".
    *   **Initial Analysis:**
        *   Searched `add-tests.js` for `add1PxStrokedRoundedRectCenteredAtGridTest`. ID: `centered-1px-rounded-rect` (shared), function: `add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRectAtGrid`, check: `withExtremesCheck`.
        *   Searched `scene-creation-rounded-rects.js` for `add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRectAtGrid` and its helper `add1PxStrokeCenteredRoundedRect`.
        *   Noted helpers: `checkCanvasHasEvenDimensions`, `placeCloseToCenterAtGrid`, `adjustDimensionsForCrispStrokeRendering`.
        *   Identified `SeededRandom` call order.
        *   Determined `checkData` logic.
        *   Proposed ID `rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid` and filename.
        *   Noted the need for a `_roundedRectPath` helper.
    *   **User Interruption (Implicit):** Request for `roundRect`, `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect` methods in `CrispSwContext` and `CanvasRenderingContext2D` polyfills.
    *   **Refactoring Actions:**
        *   Read `SWRendererRoundedRect.js` and `canvas-rounded-rect.js` to understand existing capabilities. Found `SWRendererRoundedRect.drawRoundedRect(shape)`.
        *   Modified `CrispSwContext.js`: Initialized `this.roundedRectRenderer`. Added `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect` (calling `drawRoundedRect`), and stubbed `roundRect`. Corrected color usage (direct color objects, not `fillColorWithAlpha`).
        *   Modified `canvas-sw-polyfills.js`: Added `roundRect` (path definition), `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect` (calling global `drawRoundedRectCanvas`).
    *   **Continuing Test Conversion ("Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at grid"):**
        *   Created the test file using `ctx.strokeRoundRect` (instead of a local path helper).
        *   Added to HTML files.
    *   **User Feedback:** `checkData` discrepancy. Low-level found `right=372`, high-level expected `371` (off by 1).
    *   **Action:** Corrected `checkData` in `rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js` from `Math.floor(geomX + finalRectWidth - 1)` to `Math.floor(geomX + finalRectWidth)`.
    *   **User Request:** Remove explicit `.compareWithThreshold(0,0)` as the original test didn't have it.
    *   **Action:** Removed it from the test definition.
    *   **User Feedback:** Test not added to performance tests UI (missing from `performance-tests.html`).
    *   **Action (Correction):** Confirmed it *was* added when created and included in `high-level-tests.html`. No change needed for `performance-tests.html` inclusion.

**4. Arc Method Refactor & Testing**
    *   **User Request:** Add `arc`, `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc` to `CrispSwContext` and as polyfills, similar to `roundRect`.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Read `SWRendererArc.js` (constructor, `drawArc` expects degrees). Read `canvas-arc.js` (uses degrees internally, `drawArcCanvas`).
        *   Updated `CrispSwContext.js`: Initialized `arcRenderer`. Added `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc` (taking radians, converting to degrees for the renderer). Stubbed `arc()`.
        *   Updated `canvas-sw-polyfills.js`: Added `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc` (taking radians, using native `ctx.arc()` and `fill`/`stroke`).
    *   **User Request:** Add arc tests to `crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html`.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Read `crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html` structure.
        *   Created `tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests/test-arcs.js` with `draw_filled_arc_test`, `draw_stroked_arc_test`, `draw_fill_and_stroke_arc_test`, and `createArcsTest` using `RenderTestBuilder` and `runSwCanvasCode` (mistake).
        *   Included `test-arcs.js` in `crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html` and called `createArcsTest`.
    *   **User Feedback:** Error: `runSwCanvasCode` is not a function.
    *   **Action:** Corrected `runSwCanvasCode` to `runCanvasCode` in `test-arcs.js`.
    *   **User Feedback (Relating to "90° Arcs" test, though not yet formally converted):** Canvas thickness constant, SW arcs not showing. Log and title encoding issues.
    *   **Debugging Actions (for generic `test-arcs.js` initially):**
        *   Realized `CrispSwContext.outerStrokeArc` and the canvas polyfill `outerStrokeArc` had different calling conventions regarding style arguments.
        *   Refactored `CrispSwContext` arc methods to use context state (similar to polyfills).
        *   Updated drawing functions in `test-arcs.js` to set `ctx.strokeStyle/fillStyle/lineWidth` before calling the simplified arc methods.

**5. Test: "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at pixel"** (Corrected after user clarification)
    *   **User Clarification:** Apology for misdirection; request for "Single 1px Stroked Rounded Rectangle centered at pixel" (not the non-rounded version previously misinterpreted).

        *   Identified `SeededRandom` call order.
        *   Determined `checkData` logic (using the already corrected pattern `Math.floor(geomX + finalRectWidth)`).
        *   Proposed ID `rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-pixel` and filename.
        *   Created a new test file using `ctx.strokeRoundRect`.

    *   **User Feedback:** Error: `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: addRandomLines`.
    *   **Action:** Added missing `src/scene-creation/*.js` script includes to both HTML test files (`high-level-tests.html` and `performance-tests.html`).
    *   **User Feedback:** Errors: `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: renderTestWidth`, `SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: 'CANVAS_HEIGHT'`, `ReferenceError: Can't find variable: btnRunChecked`.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Corrected `performance-tests.html` to define `renderTestWidth`/`Height` from existing `CANVAS_WIDTH`/`HEIGHT` (avoiding redeclaration).
        *   Moved event listener attachments for control buttons in `performance-ui.js` into `initializeUI()` to fix `btnRunChecked` error (ensuring DOM elements exist before listeners are attached).
    *   **User Feedback:** Performance test for combined scene still not ending.
    *   **Action:** Refactored `draw_scene_all_shapes_combined` so that in performance mode, it draws `instances` number of *full scenes*, with `effectiveIterationNumber` varied for seeding each scene.

*(The chronological breakdown above covers the major interactions. The "Files and Code Sections" below will summarize the purpose and key characteristics of affected files and highlight important snippets like `draw_scene_all_shapes_combined` or the arc/roundedRect method additions.)*

*(The current work, immediately before the original summary request, was accepting the changes for the "All Shape Types Combined" test's performance mode fix.)*

### III. Affected Files and Key Code Sections

**A. Core Guideline Document:**
*   **File:** `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md`
    *   **Importance:** Primary guide for the conversion process.
    *   **Changes:** Initially read for general understanding. Subsequently, significantly updated to reflect:
        *   Lessons learned regarding `SeededRandom` management.
        *   `checkData` calculation.
        *   Handling the `instances` parameter for various test types.
        *   New context methods.
        *   HTML page setup for visual and performance tests (including UI updates for new categories).
        *   Addition of a new troubleshooting section.
    *   **Key Snippet Example (Updated guidance for `instances` parameter JSDoc):**
        ```javascript
        // In the JSDoc for a draw_... function
        /**
         * @param {?number} instances Optional: Number of instances to draw. Passed by the performance
         *         testing harness. Its interpretation depends on the test's nature:
         *         - For tests drawing a single archetype: typically an outer loop multiplier.
         *          Each generated shape within the loop should have unique properties derived from
         *          `SeededRandom.getRandom()` calls. For performance runs, an additional `Math.random()`
         *          offset is usually applied to the position to spread shapes.
         *         - For tests designed to draw a variable number of primitives (e.g., "N random lines"):
         *          `instances` often directly dictates N.
         *         - For tests drawing a fixed, complex scene (e.g., the original `buildScene`):
         *          `instances` might control repetitions of the entire scene drawing logic (with varied seeds per scene repetition),
         *          or scale a primary component of the scene (e.g., number of one type of shape).
         *         This function's JSDoc must clearly state how `instances` is used.
        /*/
        ```

**B. Source of Low-Level Test Definitions:**
*   **File:** `src/add-tests.js`
    *   **Importance:** Contained definitions for low-level tests (IDs, shape creation functions, existing checks).
    *   **Changes:** Read-only. Searched multiple times to understand specifications for each test being converted.

**C. Original Shape Generation Logic:**
*   **Files:** `src/scene-creation/*.js` (e.g., `scene-creation-rects.js`, `scene-creation-circles.js`)
    *   **Importance:** Housed the original `add...` shape generation functions and helper utilities.
    *   **Changes:** Read-only. Logic from these files was adapted or directly called in the new high-level test drawing functions.

**D. Custom Software Rendering Context:**
*   **File:** `src/crisp-sw-canvas/CrispSwContext.js`
    *   **Importance:** The custom software rendering context being tested and extended.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Initialized `this.roundedRectRenderer` and `this.arcRenderer`.
        *   Added new methods: `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect`, `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc`. These methods were designed to use the context's current state (`fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `lineWidth`) and call the respective shape renderer (e.g., `this.roundedRectRenderer.drawRoundedRect(shape)`).
        *   The `roundRect()` and `arc()` methods (intended for path definition analogous to native canvas) were stubbed to throw errors, as generic path filling/stroking is not supported by `CrispSwContext`.
    *   **Key Snippet Example (`fillRoundRect`):**
        ```javascript
        fillRoundRect(x, y, width, height, radius) {
          const state = this.currentState;
          const cx = x + width / 2;
          const cy = y + height / 2;
          const centerTransformed = transformPoint(cx, cy, state.transform.elements);
          const rotation = getRotationAngle(state.transform.elements);
          const { scaleX, scaleY } = getScaleFactors(state.transform.elements);
          const scaledRadius = radius * Math.min(Math.abs(scaleX), Math.abs(scaleY));
          this.roundedRectRenderer.drawRoundedRect({
            center: { x: centerTransformed.tx, y: centerTransformed.ty },
            width: width * scaleX,
            height: height * scaleY,
            radius: scaledRadius,
            rotation: rotation,
            fillColor: state.fillColor, 
            strokeWidth: 0,
            strokeColor: { r: 0, g: 0, b: 0, a: 0 }
          });
        }
        ```

**E. Canvas API Polyfills:**
*   **File:** `src/canvas-sw-polyfills.js`
    *   **Importance:** Used to add missing methods to `CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype` for API consistency with `CrispSwContext` and to ensure tests run correctly on native canvas.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Added polyfills for `roundRect` (path definition using `moveTo`/`arcTo`), `fillRoundRect`, `strokeRoundRect`. The latter two call a global `drawRoundedRectCanvas` helper, assuming it's available.
        *   Added polyfills for `fillArc`, `outerStrokeArc`, `fillAndOuterStrokeArc`. These use the native `this.arc()` to build paths and then `this.fill()` or `this.stroke()`.
    *   **Key Snippet Example (`fillArc` polyfill):**
        ```javascript
        if (typeof CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillArc === 'undefined') {
          CanvasRenderingContext2D.prototype.fillArc = function(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise = false) {
            this.beginPath();
            this.moveTo(x, y); // Center of the pie slice
            this.arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle, anticlockwise);
            this.closePath(); // Connects to center, forming the slice
            this.fill();
          };
        }
        ```

**F. New High-Level Test Case Files:**
*   **Location:** `tests/browser-tests/test-cases/`
*   **Examples:**
    *   `rectangles--axalign--multi--varsize--randfill--randstroke--randpos--no-rotation--test.js`
    *   `rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot--test.js`
    *   `rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js`
    *   `circle--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js`
    *   `arcs--multi-12--90-deg--fixed-params--grid-layout--test.js`
    *   `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js`
*   **Importance:** These files contain the new high-level test logic, including the `draw_...` function, `define_..._test` function, and performance registry entries.
*   **Changes:** Each file was created from scratch, adapting logic from the original low-level tests. This involved:
    *   Managing `SeededRandom` calls precisely.
    *   Handling the `instances` parameter for performance testing.
    *   Calculating `checkData` where necessary.
    *   Using the new/polyfilled context drawing methods.
*   **Key Snippet Example (Structure of a typical `draw_...` function for a single shape, from `circle--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-pixel--test.js`):**
    ```javascript
    function draw_circle_single_1px_stroke_crisp_center_pixel(ctx, currentIterationNumber, instances = null) {
      const isPerformanceRun = instances !== null && instances > 0;
      const numToDraw = isPerformanceRun ? instances : 1;
      let logs = [];
      let checkData = null; 
      const canvasWidth = ctx.canvas.width;
      const canvasHeight = ctx.canvas.height;
      if (canvasWidth % 2 !== 0 || canvasHeight % 2 !== 0) { /* ... */ } // Error or warning
    
      for (let i = 0; i < numToDraw; i++) {
        const centerX = Math.floor(canvasWidth / 2) + 0.5;
        const centerY = Math.floor(canvasHeight / 2) + 0.5;
        const baseDiameter = Math.floor(20 + SeededRandom.getRandom() * 130);
        const adjusted = adjustDimensionsForCrispStrokeRendering(baseDiameter, baseDiameter, 1, { x: centerX, y: centerY });
        const finalDiameter = adjusted.width; 
        const radius = finalDiameter / 2;
        const r = 255, g = 0, b = 0, a = 255; // Example color
        let drawCenterX = centerX;
        let drawCenterY = centerY;
    
        if (isPerformanceRun && numToDraw > 1) {
          // For performance, spread out instances
          drawCenterX = Math.random() * canvasWidth;
          drawCenterY = Math.random() * canvasHeight;
        }
        
        ctx.strokeCircle(drawCenterX, drawCenterY, radius, 1, r, g, b, a); // Or new API ctx.strokeStyle, ctx.lineWidth, ctx.strokeCircle(x,y,r)
    
        if (!isPerformanceRun || i === 0) { 
          logs.push(/* ... relevant log data ... */);
          if (i === 0) { // Only generate checkData for the first instance in non-performance or first of performance
            checkData = { /* ... calculated check data ... */ };
          }
        }
      }
      if (isPerformanceRun) return null; // Performance runs might not return detailed logs/checkData
      return { logs, checkData };
    }
    ```

**G. HTML Test Runners:**
*   **File:** `tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html`
    *   **Importance:** HTML runner for visual regression tests.
    *   **Changes:** Modified multiple times to add `<script>` tags for newly created test case files and necessary `src/scene-creation/*.js` dependency files.
*   **File:** `tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html`
    *   **Importance:** HTML runner for performance tests.
    *   **Changes:** Modified multiple times:
        *   Added `<script>` tags for new test case files.
        *   Added `<div>` placeholders for new test categories (e.g., `rounded-rectangle-tests`, `arc-tests`, `scene-tests`).
        *   Corrected issues with `CANVAS_WIDTH`/`CANVAS_HEIGHT` re-declaration and ensured `renderTestWidth`/`renderTestHeight` were globally available for legacy scene creation functions.
        *   Added missing `src/scene-creation/*.js` script includes.

**H. Performance Test UI Logic:**
*   **File:** `tests/browser-tests/performance-tests/performance-ui.js`
    *   **Importance:** JavaScript for dynamically building the UI of the performance test page.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to:
        *   Recognize and handle new test categories (e.g., 'rounded-rectangles', 'arcs', 'scenes').
        *   Fix a bug where event listeners for control buttons (e.g., `btnRunChecked`) were attached before DOM elements were defined by moving attachments into `initializeUI()`.
        *   Correct logic for appending test items to the correct list container.

**I. `CrispSwContext` Specific Arc Tests:**
*   **File:** `tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests/test-arcs.js`
    *   **Importance:** Created to provide basic visual tests for the new arc drawing methods on `CrispSwContext`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   Created with `draw_filled_arc_test`, `draw_stroked_arc_test`, `draw_fill_and_stroke_arc_test` functions and a `createArcsTest` function to register them.
        *   Initially used `runSwCanvasCode`, then corrected to `runCanvasCode`.
        *   Calls to arc methods were updated to set context styles (`strokeStyle`, `fillStyle`, `lineWidth`) first, after API harmonization.
*   **File:** `tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html`
    *   **Importance:** HTML runner for `CrispSwContext`-specific tests.
    *   **Changes:** Modified to include `test-arcs.js` and call `createArcsTest()`.

### IV. Summary of Problem Solving and Debugging

Throughout the conversion process, various issues were encountered and resolved:

*   **Linting Errors:** Corrected escaped backticks in generated JavaScript template literals.
*   **Incorrect Test ID Format:** Refactored a test file to use a more descriptive ID and filename matching project conventions.
*   **Performance Test UI Issues:**
    *   **Tests not appearing:** Resolved by adding new category `<div>`s to `performance-tests.html` and updating `performance-ui.js` to handle these new categories.
    *   **`ReferenceError: Can't find variable: btnRunChecked`:** Fixed by moving event listener attachments within `performance-ui.js` into the `initializeUI` function, ensuring DOM elements exist prior to attachment.
*   **Renderer Initialization (`ReferenceError: Can't find variable: SWRendererRoundedRect`):**
    *   Initially suspected a stale build of `crisp-sw-canvas-v1.0.2.min.js`.
    *   User clarified they fixed the build. The issue was addressed by ensuring `CrispSwContext.js` correctly initialized `this.roundedRectRenderer` (this was actually done prior to the specific error report, likely a caching or load order issue at the time of user report).
*   **Character Encoding:** Test titles and log messages displaying incorrect characters (e.g., "Â°", "â—œ") were fixed by using Unicode escape sequences (e.g., `\u00B0` for degree symbol, `\u25DC` for arc symbol) in JavaScript strings.
*   **Performance Test Scaling:**
    *   For tests drawing a fixed set of shapes (e.g., "90° Arcs", "All Shape Types Combined"), the drawing logic was refactored to scale with the `instances` parameter.
    *   "90° Arcs" test: Now draws `instances` number of randomized arcs in performance mode.
    *   "All Shape Types Combined" test: Now draws `instances` number of full scenes, with varied seeding for each scene instance.
*   **Missing Global Variables:**
    *   **`ReferenceError: Can't find variable: addRandomLines` (and similar for other `add...` functions):** Resolved by adding missing `src/scene-creation/*.js` script includes to `high-level-tests.html` and `performance-tests.html`.
    *   **`ReferenceError: Can't find variable: renderTestWidth`:** Resolved by defining `renderTestWidth` and `renderTestHeight` as global variables in `performance-tests.html`, initialized from the canvas dimensions used on that page.
    *   **`SyntaxError: Can't create duplicate variable: 'CANVAS_HEIGHT'`:** Fixed by removing an erroneous re-declaration of `CANVAS_WIDTH` and `CANVAS_HEIGHT` in `performance-tests.html` and ensuring `renderTestWidth`/`Height` were set from the existing constants.
*   **Incorrect Method Call (`TypeError: ...runSwCanvasCode is not a function`):** Corrected to `runCanvasCode` in `test-arcs.js`.
*   **Incorrect Function Signature Usage:** Corrected the call to `getRandomPoint` in `rectangles--rotated--multi--varsize--randparams--randpos--randrot--test.js` to match its proper signature.
*   **`checkData` Discrepancies:** Adjusted the calculation of `rightX` and `bottomY` for `withExtremesCheck` in `rounded-rect--single--1px-stroke--crisp--center-grid--test.js`. This was based on observed behavior and guide examples for 1px strokes at `.5` coordinate boundaries (pixel centers).
*   **API Mismatch for Arc Drawing:**
    *   Initial `outerStrokeArc` and related methods in `CrispSwContext` took color/width arguments directly.
    *   Canvas polyfills relied on context properties (`fillStyle`, `strokeStyle`, `lineWidth`).
    *   Harmonized by making `CrispSwContext` methods also use context state properties. Test scripts were updated to set these properties before calling the arc methods.

### V. State of Work Prior to Original Summary Document

The last active coding task completed before the generation of the original `work_summary.md` document was the conversion of the **"Multiple Precise Fill-Only Circles"** low-level test. This involved:

1.  **Analysis:**
    *   Reviewed original `addMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCirclesTest` and its shape creation function `addMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCircles` (which calls `generateMultiplePreciseCircles` with `includeStrokes: false`).
2.  **Implementation:**
    *   Created a new high-level test file: `tests/browser-tests/test-cases/circles--multi-12--precise--no-stroke--randparams--randpos--test.js`.
    *   The `draw_circles_multi_12_precise_no_stroke_randparams_randpos` function was implemented to:
        *   Adapt logic from `calculateCircleParameters` (with options for "precise" circles and `hasStroke: false`) into a local helper named `_calculateMultiplePreciseNoStrokeCirclesParams`.
        *   Draw 12 fill-only circles using `ctx.fillCircle()`.
        *   Handle performance instancing via the `instances` parameter.
        *   Include appropriate metadata for `RenderTestBuilder` and performance registration.
3.  **Integration:**
    *   Added the new test file to `tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html` and `tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html`.
4.  **User Confirmation:** The user accepted these changes.
5.  **Final User Feedback before Summary:** The user confirmed that fixes for the "90° Arcs" performance test (scaling and endless loop) and log/title display issues (character encoding) were working correctly.
