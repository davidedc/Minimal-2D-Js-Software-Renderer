## Session 2: Test Case Naming Convention Refinement

This session details the collaborative project to analyze existing test cases and establish a new, standardized file naming convention. The primary objective was to create a filename structure that clearly and consistently captures all significant aspects (facets) of each test in a regular and orthogonal manner.

### I. Project Goals and Data Sources

**A. Goal:**
To develop a systematic file naming convention by:
1.  Deeply studying existing naming conventions.
2.  Analyzing test file contents (`.js` scripts).
3.  Referencing guideline documents to extract and standardize descriptive facets.

**B. Data Sources:**
*   **Test Scripts (Primary Source for Facet Value Determination):**
    *   Modern test cases: `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/`
    *   Legacy performance tests: `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`
    *   *Content of these `.js` files was analyzed to determine precise parameter ranges, behaviors, and thus, facet values (e.g., for `StrokeThickness`, `SizeCategory`).*
*   **Guideline Documents (Provided by User):**
    *   `CONVERTING_LOW_LEVEL_TESTS.md`
    *   `adding-performance-tests.md`
    *   `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md` (Crucial for defining standardized `SizeCategory` pixel ranges).
    *   *These documents informed initial facet extraction and parameter interpretation.*

### II. Evolution of the Analysis Table (`test_case_naming_analysis_vX.md`)

The core of this project was the iterative refinement of a Markdown table designed to break down each test into its constituent facets. This table evolved through several versions, with user feedback and deeper analysis at each step.

**Initial Table (Conceptual Version 1 - `test_case_naming_analysis.md`)**
*   **User Request:** Create a Markdown table with columns: "Current Test Name", "Test Description", "Current Facets (from filename & .md)", "Suggested New Facets", and "Uncaptured Aspects".
*   **Assistant Action:** Generated an initial table by parsing filenames and extracting information from the provided `.md` guideline documents. "Suggested New Facets" was a placeholder, and "Uncaptured Aspects" noted potential missing information.

**User Interjection: Spreadsheet Edit (Conceptual Version 2 - based on `test_case_naming_analysis v2.txt`)**
*   The user indicated they had created and tweaked a spreadsheet version of this table. This user-modified version became the implicit basis for subsequent refinements, particularly influencing the `SizeCategory` column initially.

**Table Version 3 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v3.md`) - Refining `SizeCategory` (First Pass)**
*   **User Request:** Based on the user-edited spreadsheet, refine the `SizeCategory` column. Values should be standardized to `XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL`, `mixed`, or `N/A`, removing parenthetical comments. The user emphasized examining source code for appropriate sizes, even for randomized values.
*   **Assistant Action:** `SizeCategory` was refined. *Full source code examination for this specific refinement was not yet fully utilized; reliance was primarily on filename cues and previous table inferences.*

**Table Version 4 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v4.md`) - Further `SizeCategory` Refinement**
*   **User Request:** Clarify `mixed` for `SizeCategory`: only if randomization *spans* defined buckets (XS-XL), not just if randomized within one. Lines should also have a size category based on length per guidelines.
*   **Assistant Action:** Updated logic to better interpret filename cues for explicit size buckets (e.g., `--m-size--`) alongside randomization terms. Addressed line sizes based on filename hints.

**Table Version 5 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v5.md`) - Corrected `SizeCategory` Logic**
*   **User Correction:** User explicitly stated the assistant *can* examine test source code, correcting a previous assumption.
*   **User Request:** Re-address `SizeCategory` with the confirmed capability to analyze file contents to determine if randomized sizes stay within a specific bucket.
*   **Assistant Action:** `SizeCategory` column processed again with more robust logic, aiming for accurate XS-XL or `mixed` assignments, emphasizing future need to consult source code directly.

**Table Version 6 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v6.md`) - Refining `FillStyle`**
*   **User Request:** Refine `FillStyle` to only `none`, `opaque`, `semitransparent`, or `mixed`. Remove parenthesized comments. Examine source code if needed.
*   **Assistant Action:** Updated `FillStyle` based on filenames, previous table data (e.g., color alpha from `getRandomColor`), and explicit mentions (e.g., `--no-fill--`). Standardized values.

**Table Version 7 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v7.md`) - Refining `StrokeStyle`**
*   **User Request:** Similar refinement for `StrokeStyle` (values: `none`, `opaque`, `semitransparent`, `mixed`, `N/A`). Examine source code if needed.
*   **Assistant Action:** Refined `StrokeStyle` by analyzing filenames (e.g., `--no-stroke--`, `opaque_stroke`), inferring from stroke operations, and color properties.

**Table Version 8 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v8.md`) - Refining `StrokeThickness` (First Pass)**
*   **User Request:** Standardize `StrokeThickness` to `none`, `[N]px`, `[N]px-[M]px` (ranges), or `mixed` (scattered/non-interval random). Eliminate t-shirt sizing (XS-XL). Emphasized source code use.
*   **Assistant Action:** Processed `StrokeThickness`. Prioritized filename cues for explicit pixel values (e.g., `--1px-stroke--`). Some t-shirt sizes were missed in this pass.

**User Interjection: Major Restructure (Leading to Conceptual `v9.md` and then `v10.md`)**
*   **User Request (before `v8` review):** Major restructuring based on user's offline edits:
    *   Split `Positioning` into `Layout`, `CenteredAt`, `EdgeAlignment`.
    *   Merge `Orientation` and `Rotation` into a new `Orientation` column.
    *   Remove `RenderingHint`, `ParameterRandomization`, `LayoutArrangement`.
    *   Emphasized verifying all values by referencing source code.
*   **Assistant Action:** Performed restructuring. Initially populated `Layout`. Removed comments. Removed `RectAlignment` and `SceneDetails`. Set specific `mixed` values for `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js` facets.

**Table Version 10 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v10.md` - Based on User's Edited V9, saved as `v11.md` by assistant initially)**
*   **User Action:** Provided a slightly edited version of the restructured table (their conceptual `v9`).
*   **Assistant Action (leading to file `test_case_naming_analysis_v11.md`):**
    *   Read user-provided `v10.md`.
    *   Refined `Layout` column based on `spread` vs. `random` distinction.
    *   Re-applied/confirmed other user requests for `v10` (comment removal, column removal, scene test updates).
    *   Refreshed `Uncaptured Aspects`.
    *   *(Assistant saved this as `test_case_naming_analysis_v11.md` after a versioning misstep.)*

**Table Version 11 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v11.md`)**
*   This file was the result of operations intended for `v10.md` (after user clarification on versioning).
*   Contained: refined `Layout`, removed columns (`RectAlignment`, `SceneDetails`), removed parenthetical comments, specific `mixed` values for `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js` facets.

**Table Version 12 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v12.md`) - Correcting `StrokeThickness` (Persisting Issues)**
*   **User Request:** Pointed out t-shirt sizes (L, M, XL) and an `unknown` value still in `StrokeThickness` of `v11.md`.
*   **Assistant Action:** Re-processed `StrokeThickness` in `v11.md`. Converted t-shirt sizes to `mixed` (placeholder if code analysis not immediate). Targeted `unknown` for resolution (often to `mixed` or value from filename).

**Table Version 13 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v13.md`) - `StrokeThickness` Code-Driven Refinement (Attempt 1)**
*   **User Request:** Re-evaluate `StrokeThickness` strictly to `none`, `[N]px`, `[N]px-[M]px`, or `mixed`. Derive ranges/values from source code. Replace t-shirt sizes and `unknown` values.
*   **Assistant Action:** Attempted systematic update. Some `unknown` values resolved to `1px` (from filename). T-shirt sizes provisionally `mixed` if legacy file access/analysis was pending.

**Table Version 14 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v14.md`) - Deeper `StrokeThickness` Refinement (from `test-cases/` directory)**
*   **User Request:** Continue `StrokeThickness` refinement by analyzing `.js` files in `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` that had `mixed` or provisional ranges.
*   **Assistant Action:** Updated `StrokeThickness` for several files in `test-cases/` from `mixed` or broad ranges (e.g., `1px-11px`) to precise `[N]px` or `[N]px-[M]px` values (e.g., `1px-10px`) based on code inspection (e.g., `SeededRandom.getRandom() * X + Y`). Confirmed some `mixed` values if code showed discrete, non-continuous stroke widths (e.g., 2, 4, 6px). Legacy files with t-shirt sizes remained `mixed` pending direct code access.

**Table Version 15 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v15.md`) - Final `StrokeThickness` Refinement (Legacy File Analysis)**
*   **User Request:** Complete `StrokeThickness` by analyzing provided source code for legacy test files (from `/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`) still having `mixed` (from t-shirt size conversions).
*   **Assistant Action:** Updated `StrokeThickness` for the four specified legacy files (e.g., `lines--M-size--no-fill--L-opaque-stroke...`) from `mixed` to specific `[N]px-[M]px` ranges (e.g., `1px-5px`, `10px-20px`) based on direct JavaScript source analysis.

**Table Version 16 (`test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md`) - `SizeCategory` Refinement (Standardized Pixel Ranges)**
*   **User Request:** Revise `SizeCategory`. Determine by analyzing test source code from `test-cases/` and `performance-tests-legacy/` and comparing actual shape dimensions against standardized pixel ranges defined in `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md` (XS, S, M, L, XL for lines, rectangles, circles).
*   **Assistant Action:**
    *   Analyzed each test file.
    *   Extracted shape dimensions (length for lines, width/height for rects/rounded-rects, radius for circles) from code.
    *   Compared dimensions against standard pixel buckets.
    *   If dimensions (or randomized ranges) fell within a single bucket, that category was assigned.
    *   If dimensions spanned multiple buckets, or if multiple shapes in a test had different size categories, `SizeCategory` was set to `mixed`.
    *   Filename cues were hints, superseded by code analysis.
    *   Arc radii were compared to circle categories.
    *   This resulted in `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` with a more rigorously defined `SizeCategory`.

### III. Current State (Reflected in `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md`)

The table `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` represents the most current and detailed breakdown of test facets. It has undergone multiple refinement passes for columns including `FillStyle`, `StrokeStyle`, `StrokeThickness`, and `SizeCategory`. A major restructuring introduced `Layout`, `CenteredAt`, `EdgeAlignment`, and a revised `Orientation` column, while removing others. All parenthetical comments have been eliminated.

The facet values, particularly for `StrokeThickness` and `SizeCategory`, are now directly informed by detailed analysis of the JavaScript test files located in:
*   `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/`
*   `/Users/davidedellacasa/code/Minimal-2D-Js-Software-Renderer/tests/browser-tests/performance-tests-legacy/`

These values are compared against standardized definitions where available (e.g., pixel ranges for `SizeCategory` from `adding-tests-to-legacy-performance-tests-setup.md`).

### IV. Purpose of this Document Section (within `project_summary_and_context.md`)

This section of the overall summary (`work_summary.md`, originally `project_summary_and_context.md`) serves as a comprehensive log of the naming convention project's progression. It details the rationale behind changes to the analysis table (`test_case_naming_analysis_vX.md`) and the criteria applied to each facet. Its aim is to provide clarity on how `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` was derived, thereby facilitating the final steps of defining canonical facet values and establishing the new file naming convention.

### V. Next Steps (Following `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md`)

The immediate next steps for the naming convention project are:
1.  **User Review:** Thorough review of `test_case_naming_analysis_v16.md` by the user.
2.  **Canonical Facet Values:** Define the standardized set of allowed string values for each facet that will form part of the new filenames.
3.  **Filename Structure Definition:** Define the exact structure of the new filenames, including which facets to include, their order, and separators.
4.  **File Renaming:** Plan and execute the renaming of the test files based on the newly established convention.
