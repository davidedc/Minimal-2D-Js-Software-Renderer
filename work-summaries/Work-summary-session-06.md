## Session 6: Test Cases: T-shirt Sizing Harmonization

This session details a major refactoring of the T-shirt sizing system to resolve ambiguities and ensure consistency.

### I. T-Shirt Sizing System Refactoring

**A. Problem Identification:**
The user expressed concern about overlapping pixel ranges in the T-shirt sizing system defined in `test_case_naming_analysis_explained.md` (e.g., Circle Radius `M`: 10-50px and `L`: 40-100px).

**B. Assistant's Approach and Actions:**
1.  **Overlap Analysis:** All sizing definitions were analyzed, and overlaps were confirmed and itemized for `Lines`, `Rectangles`, and `Circles`.
2.  **Initial Fix Proposal (Non-Overlapping Ranges):** A fix was proposed to make the existing three sizing schemes internally consistent by adjusting the ranges to be sequential (e.g., `M: 10-49px`, `L: 50-99px`).
3.  **User-Prompted Harmonization:** The user requested a more advanced solution: a single, harmonized T-shirt sizing system for all shapes to address inconsistencies *between* shape types.
4.  **Unified System Proposal:** A new, unified system was proposed:
    *   **A single, non-overlapping scale** for all linear pixel measurements.
    *   **Clear application rules** for how to apply this scale to different shapes.

**D. The New Harmonized Sizing System:**

**Unified T-Shirt Size Scale:**
| Size Category | Unified Pixel Range |
| :--- | :--- |
| **XS** | `5-15px` |
| **S** | `16-39px` |
| **M** | `40-79px` |
| **L** | `80-159px` |
| **XL** | `160-400px` |

**Application Rules:**
*   **For `lines`**: Apply the scale to the line's **length**.
*   **For `circles` and `arcs`**: Apply the scale to the shape's **radius**.
*   **For `rectangles` and `rounded-rects`**: Apply the scale to the rectangle's **longest side** (`Math.max(width, height)`).

**E. Documentation Update:**
*   Upon user approval, the documentation was updated to reflect this new system.
*   **File Edited:** `test_case_naming_analysis_explained.md`
*   **Change:** The entire "SizeCategory" section was replaced with the definition of the new unified scale and its application rules.

### IV. Next Steps and Unresolved Issues

*   **Outdated TSV Data:** The `SizeCategory` column in `test_case_naming_analysis_v19.tsv` is now based on obsolete rules. A full re-evaluation of all tests against the new harmonized sizing system is required to make the data accurate again. This is the most critical follow-up task.
*   **File Renaming:** Once the TSV data is fully corrected, the project can proceed with the physical renaming of all test files according to the new convention.
*   **Header Propagation:** The new test summary header format could be propagated to other test files.
