# Work Summary - Session 03

This session focused on refactoring the test case registration mechanism for a JavaScript 2D software renderer. The primary goal was to centralize and simplify how individual test scripts are defined and registered for both visual regression testing (using `RenderTestBuilder`) and performance testing (using `window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY`).

## User Requests & Intents:

1.  **Initial Request (Message 1):** Study a comprehensive set of documentation files related to the project, its testing frameworks, and naming conventions.
    *   **Intent:** To ensure the AI assistant has a deep understanding of the existing system before proceeding with refactoring tasks.

2.  **Second Request (Message 2):** After being provided with a list of test files from `/tests/browser-tests/test-cases/`, the user asked for a ranked list of suggestions on how to refactor them, focusing on extracting common code and simplifying scaffolding, without actually changing any code yet.
    *   **Intent:** To get actionable, prioritized refactoring ideas.

3.  **Third Request (Message 3):** User asked to proceed with implementing the first ranked suggestion: "Automate Test Definition & Performance Registration from Filename."
    *   **Intent:** Begin the refactoring process by creating a centralized helper function.

4.  **Subsequent Requests (Message 4 onwards):** User guided the implementation process step-by-step, including creating the utility file, updating HTML files, and then refactoring individual test files in batches.
    *   **Intent:** Incremental implementation and verification of the new refactoring approach.

5.  **Specific TODO resolutions (Messages after initial refactoring batch):**
    *   User requested to address a `TODO` related to `noGapsInFillEdgesCheck`.
    *   User requested to address a `TODO` related to `uniqueColors` for `withColorCheckMiddleColumn` and correct the initial misinterpretation of `withUniqueColorsCheck`.
    *   **Intent:** Ensure the new helper function comprehensively covers the check configurations used in the original test definitions.

## Assistant's Approach & Actions:

1.  **Understanding Phase:**
    *   Acknowledged reading and understanding all provided documentation (9 files covering project overview, testing methodologies, naming conventions, etc.).

2.  **Suggestion Phase:**
    *   After analyzing the provided test files (implicitly, as no explicit read was done before suggestions), the assistant provided a ranked list of refactoring suggestions:
        1.  Automate Test Definition & Performance Registration from Filename.
        2.  Abstract `draw_...` Function Scaffolding.
        3.  Centralize Common Helper Functions.
        4.  Standardize `checkData` Structure and Logging.
        5.  Create Presets for Common `RenderTestBuilder` Check Combinations.
        6.  Parameterize Similar Tests.

3.  **Implementation of Suggestion 1 (Centralized Test Registration Helper):**

    *   **Task 1.1 (Assistant-led):** Defined the signature and behavior of a new helper function `registerHighLevelTest`.
        *   **Signature:** `registerHighLevelTest(filename, drawFunction, category, checkConfiguration, performanceTestConfig = {})`
        *   **`checkConfiguration` Structure (evolved during session):**
            ```javascript
            {
                compare: { swTol: number, refTol: number, diffTol: number },
                extremes: boolean | { tolerance: number },
                uniqueColors: { 
                    middleRow?: { count: number, tolerance?: number, inCenterThird?: boolean },
                    middleColumn?: { count: number, tolerance?: number, inCenterThird?: boolean }
                },
                totalUniqueColors: number | { count: number, /* potential options */ }, // For global unique colors check
                continuousStroke: boolean | { tolerance: number },
                speckles: boolean | { maxSpeckleSize?: number, tolerance?: number },
                noOffscreenPixels: boolean,
                noGapsInFillEdges: boolean,
                noGapsInStrokeEdges: boolean,
                drawFunctionArgs: [] // Arguments for runCanvasCode
            }
            ```
        *   **`performanceTestConfig` Structure:** ` { id?: string, displayName?: string, description?: string, title?: string /* for visual test title override */ }`
        *   **Internal Logic:** Parses filename for defaults (ID, title, description), uses provided category, applies checks to `RenderTestBuilder`, and registers with `window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY`.

    *   **Task 1.2:** Implemented `registerHighLevelTest` in a new file `tests/browser-tests/test-utils/test-registration-utils.js`.
        *   **File Created:** `tests/browser-tests/test-utils/test-registration-utils.js`
        *   **Code Snippet (Initial Core Logic):**
            ```javascript
            function registerHighLevelTest(filename, drawFunction, category, checkConfiguration, performanceTestConfig = {}) {
                const baseId = filename.replace(/--test\.js$/, '');
                // ... (filename parsing for defaultTitle, defaultDescription, defaultPerfDisplayName)

                if (typeof RenderTestBuilder === 'function') {
                    let builder = new RenderTestBuilder();
                    builder.withId(baseId)
                        .withTitle(performanceTestConfig.title || defaultTitle)
                        .withDescription(performanceTestConfig.description || defaultDescription)
                        .runCanvasCode(drawFunction, ...(checkConfiguration && checkConfiguration.drawFunctionArgs ? checkConfiguration.drawFunctionArgs : []));
                    // ... (logic to apply checks from checkConfiguration)
                    builder.build();
                }

                if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && typeof window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY !== 'undefined' && typeof drawFunction === 'function') {
                    // ... (logic to push to PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY, handling defaults and overrides)
                }
            }
            ```

    *   **Task 1.3:** Updated HTML files to include `test-registration-utils.js`.
        *   Edited `tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html`.
        *   Edited `tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html`.

    *   **Phase 2 (Tasks 2.1 - 2.36, excluding skipped file):** Refactored 35 test case files in `tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` to use the new `registerHighLevelTest` function.
        *   For each file, the assistant read the file, analyzed its existing `define_..._test()` function and performance registration block.
        *   Determined the appropriate `category`, `checkConfiguration`, and `performanceTestConfig` arguments for `registerHighLevelTest`.
        *   Used the `edit_file` tool to replace the old boilerplate with a single call to the new helper.
        *   **Example of refactored call (from `scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js`):
            ```javascript
            registerHighLevelTest(
                'scene--all-shapes-combined--test.js',
                draw_scene_all_shapes_combined,
                'scenes',
                {
                    compare: { swTol: 0, refTol: 0, diffTol: 0 }
                },
                {
                    displayName: 'Perf: Scene All Combined',
                    description: 'Performance of drawing a combined scene with multiple shape types.'
                }
            );
            ```
        *   **Encountered Issues & Resolutions:** For some files (e.g., `rounded-rect--single--rand-semitrans-stroke-fill--crisp-center--test.js`), the `edit_file` tool initially failed to apply changes correctly. The assistant switched to a full content replacement strategy for these problematic files, which was successful.
        *   **File Skipped:** `rounded-rect--single--rand-semitrans-stroke-fill--crisp-center--test.js` was initially skipped due to persistent tool issues but was successfully refactored later using the full content replacement strategy.

    *   **Addressing TODOs / Refining Helper:**
        *   **`drawFunctionArgs`:** Modified `test-registration-utils.js` to allow `checkConfiguration` to include `drawFunctionArgs: []` which are then spread when calling `builder.runCanvasCode(drawFunction, ...drawFunctionArgs)`. This was necessary for tests like `lines--multi_20--...` that passed an `initialCount` to their draw function.
        *   **`noGapsInFillEdgesCheck`:** Added `if (checkConfiguration.noGapsInFillEdges) { builder.withNoGapsInFillEdgesCheck(); }` to the helper. Updated `circle--single--no-stroke--randparams--crisp--randpos-explicit--test.js` and `circle--single--no-stroke--randparams--crisp-center--randpos-type--test.js` to use `noGapsInFillEdges: true`.
        *   **`uniqueColors` (for middleRow/middleColumn) & `totalUniqueColors` (for global check):** This was a key correction. The initial refactoring had misinterpreted `withUniqueColorsCheck(count)` as applying to a middle row.
            *   The helper was modified: The `checkConfiguration.uniqueColors` property was changed to expect sub-objects: `middleRow: { count, ... }` and/or `middleColumn: { count, ... }`.
            *   A new property `checkConfiguration.totalUniqueColors: number | { count: number }` was added to call `builder.withUniqueColorsCheck()`.
            *   The 7 test files originally using `withUniqueColorsCheck(N)` were corrected to use `totalUniqueColors: N`.
            *   Other test files that were incorrectly changed to `uniqueColors: { middleRow: ... }` (when they actually used checks like `withColorCheckMiddleRow` and `withColorCheckMiddleColumn` for lines, or `withColorCheckMiddleRow` for rounded rects) were updated to the correct `uniqueColors: { middleRow: { count: X }, middleColumn: { count: Y } }` structure.
        *   **`noGapsInStrokeEdgesCheck`:** Added `if (checkConfiguration.noGapsInStrokeEdges) { builder.withNoGapsInStrokeEdgesCheck(); }` to the helper. Updated `circle--single--fully-random--test.js`, `circle--single--randparams--crisp--randpos-explicit--test.js`, and `circle--single--randparams--crisp-center--randpos-type--test.js` to use `noGapsInStrokeEdges: true`.

## Key Decisions, Concepts, & Patterns:

*   **Centralized Registration Logic:** The core idea was to move boilerplate code for test definition (`RenderTestBuilder`) and performance registration (`PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY.push`) into a single utility function (`registerHighLevelTest`).
*   **Filename-Driven Defaults:** The helper function derives default test IDs, titles, and descriptions from the test script's filename, promoting consistency and reducing manual configuration.
*   **Configuration Objects:** Complex check setups and performance overrides are managed via `checkConfiguration` and `performanceTestConfig` objects passed to the helper.
*   **Conditional Registration:** The helper checks for the existence of `RenderTestBuilder` and `window.PERFORMANCE_TESTS_REGISTRY` before attempting to register, allowing test files to be used in different environments.
*   **Iterative Refinement of Helper:** The `registerHighLevelTest` function and its `checkConfiguration` structure were iteratively refined as more test cases were refactored and specific check requirements (like `drawFunctionArgs` or different types of color checks) were encountered and addressed.
*   **Tooling Challenges:** The `edit_file` tool sometimes failed to apply diff-based changes, especially for multiline deletions/replacements in certain files. Switching to a full file content replacement strategy resolved these issues for the problematic files.
*   **Clarification of Terminology:** The distinction between `title` (for visual tests) and `displayName` (for performance tests) was clarified.

## Outcome:

All 36 test files in the `tests/browser-tests/test-cases/` directory were successfully refactored to use the new `registerHighLevelTest` utility. The helper function in `tests/browser-tests/test-utils/test-registration-utils.js` was enhanced to support a wider range of check configurations based on the original test definitions, including specific handling for different types of unique color checks and checks for gaps in fills/strokes. The test registration process is now significantly more concise and centralized for these files.
