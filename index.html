    <h1>2D JS SW Renderer Tests & Demos</h1>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="tests/browser-tests/high-level-tests.html">High-Level Rendering Tests</a></h2>
        <p>
            Tests comparing the custom software renderer against the native Canvas API using a higher-level, canvas-like interface for scene definition (e.g., `ctx.fillRect`, `ctx.strokeLine`). Focuses on verifying visual fidelity and correctness, particularly for crisp rendering scenarios.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="tests/browser-tests/low-level-renderer-tests.html">Low-level SW Renderer routines tests</a></h2>
        <p>
            Comprehensive tests for the low-level software renderer routines.
            Tests low-level primitives like lines, rectangles, rounded rectangles, arcs and circles,
            comparing them with the equivalent canvas rendering methods. <br>
            <br>
            These tests only cover strokes/fills with transparency in absolute coordinates (i.e. no transformations), no clipping.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="tests/browser-tests/crisp-sw-canvas-tests.html">CrispSwCanvas tests</a></h2>
        <p>
            A side-by-side comparison between CrispSwCanvas and standard HTML5 Canvas.
            CrispSwCanvas provides transformations, globalAlpha and clipping on top of the low-level renderer routines.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="examples/minimal-sw-canvas-example.html">CrispSwCanvas minimal example</a></h2>
        <p>
            A minimal example of using CrispSwCanvas.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="tests/browser-tests/code-coverage-tests.html">CrispSwCanvas code coverage tests</a></h2>
        <p>
            Just to check that the build library as all the code needed and only the code needed.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="tests/browser-tests/performance-tests.html">Performance comparison tests</a></h2>
        <p>
            Measures and compares the rendering performance between Software Canvas and HTML5 Canvas.
            Shows how many shapes each implementation can render within a 16.7ms frame budget (60fps target),
            with visual results and comparative charts.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="supporting-experiments/canvas-crispness-examples/canvas-crispness-tests.html">HTML5 Canvas Crispness examples</a></h2>
        <p>
            Detailed exploration of HTML5 Canvas rendering crispness, including pixel-perfect
            drawing techniques, coordinate system explanations, and various examples
            of strokes and fills. <br>
            <br>
            This helps understanding how HTML5 Canvas drawing works in respect to the precise positioning of strokes and fills, specifically for the cases useful for GUI drawing where one wants to draw axis-aligned fills and strokes (thin or thick) crisply.
        </p>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="supporting-experiments/canvas-transform-effects-on-strokes-demo.html">Canvas Transform Effects on Strokes</a></h2>
        <p>
            Demonstrates how transforms have complex effects on not only paths, but also on the exact shape of the strokes related to those paths. <br>
            <br>
            For example, in a stroke of a rectangle on which a "scale x" is applied, not only the rectangle is stretched, but also the strokes, so the vertical strokes become thicker than the horizontal ones. This demo helps visualize these subtle effects that must be considered when implementing a software renderer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="demo-link">
        <h2><a href="supporting-experiments/canvas-stroke-as-clipping-demo.html">Canvas Stroke as Clipping Test</a></h2>
        <p>
            Demonstrates that the strokes of shapes in HTML5 Canvas are NOT part of the clipping areas for subsequent drawings (only the fills are). <br>
            I.e. when using clip() on a path, Canvas only uses the mathematical path (with no thickness) as the clipping region. The demo shows this behavior with lines and rectangles, confirming that even when a shape has a thick stroke, the clipping region only follows the path outline without including the stroke area.
