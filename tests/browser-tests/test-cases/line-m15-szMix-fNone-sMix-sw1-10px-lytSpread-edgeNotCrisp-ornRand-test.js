/**
 * TEST SUMMARY:
 * =================
 *
 * Description: 15 lines, no fill, random stroke, random positions, random orientations.

 *
 * | Facet                  | Value          | Reason
 * |------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Shape category         | lines          | The test draws lines using `ctx.strokeLine()`.
 * | Count                  | multi-15       | The test is configured to draw 15 lines in a loop for its visual regression mode.
 * | SizeCategory           | mixed          | Line start/end points are random within canvas bounds, so line length can vary greatly, spanning all size categories (XS-XL).
 * | FillStyle              | none           | The test only calls `ctx.strokeLine()` and does not use any fill operations.
 * | StrokeStyle            | mixed          | The stroke alpha is randomized in `[150, 255]`, resulting in both opaque (alpha=255) and semi-transparent strokes.
 * | StrokeThickness        | 1px-10px       | `ctx.lineWidth` is set to `Math.floor(SeededRandom.getRandom() * 10) + 1`, yielding an integer in the range [1, 10].
 * | Layout                 | spread         | Each line's start and end points are randomized independently, distributing them across the canvas.
 * | CenteredAt             | N/A            | This facet is not applicable to line primitives.
 * | EdgeAlignment          | not-crisp      | Line coordinates are fully random floating-point values with no logic to align them to pixel boundaries.
 * | Orientation            | random         | With both start and end points chosen randomly, the resulting line orientation is also random.
 * | ArcAngleExtent         | N/A            | This facet is only applicable to arc shapes.
 * | RoundRectRadius        | N/A            | This facet is only applicable to rounded rectangle shapes.
 * | ContextTranslation     | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.translate()`.
 * | ContextRotation        | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.rotate()`.
 * | ContextScaling         | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.scale()`.
 * | Clipped on shape       | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.clip()`.
 * | Clipped on shape count | n/a            | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape arrangement | n/a      | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape size  | n/a            | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape edge alignment | n/a   | Not applicable as there is no clipping.

 *
 * UNCAPTURED ASPECTS IN FILENAME / FACETS ABOVE:
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Stroke color has randomized RGB values and an alpha randomized in the range [150, 255]. strokeWidth: floor(SR.get()*10)+1 => 1-10px. Line length [1,~301) spans XS,S,M,L,XL.

/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Test definition for rendering multiple (typically 15 for visual regression,
 * 'instances' count for performance) lines with random thickness, color (including alpha),
 * positions, and orientations.
 *
 * Guiding Principles for this draw function:
 * - General:
 *   - The function is designed to draw a variable number of lines with varied properties.
 *   - `RenderTest` handles initial seeding of `SeededRandom.getRandom()`.
 * - `initialCount` Parameter:
 *   - Defines the number of lines for a standard visual test run.
 *   - Passed to `runCanvasCode` by the `define_..._test` function.
 * - `instances` Parameter (for Performance Testing):
 *   - If provided (not null and > 0), signifies a performance test run.
 *   - The function will then draw 'instances' number of lines instead of 'initialCount'.
 *   - Logging is skipped, and `null` is returned in this mode.
 * - Return Value:
 *   - Returns an object with a `logs` array for single/initialCount runs.
 *   - Returns `null` if `instances` is set (performance mode) or if no logs are generated.
 *   - No `checkData` is returned as this test primarily focuses on rendering capability
 *     and visual variety, rather than precise checks.
