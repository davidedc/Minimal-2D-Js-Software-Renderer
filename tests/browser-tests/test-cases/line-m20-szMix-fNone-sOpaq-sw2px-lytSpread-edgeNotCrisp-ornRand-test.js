 * TEST SUMMARY:
 * =================
 *
 * Description: Renders 20 lines with a 2px black opaque stroke. The lines have random positions and orientations.

 * | Facet                  | Value          | Reason
 * |------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * | Shape category         | lines          | The test draws primitives using `ctx.strokeLine()`.
 * | Count                  | multi-20       | The test is configured to draw 20 instances in its standard visual regression mode (`initialCount = 20`).
 * | SizeCategory           | mixed          | Line length is determined by two random points on the canvas, so it can span multiple size categories (XS-XL).
 * | FillStyle              | none           | `ctx.fillStyle` is explicitly set to be fully transparent (`rgba(0,0,0,0)`), and only a stroke operation is performed.
 * | StrokeStyle            | opaque         | `ctx.strokeStyle` is set to `'rgb(0,0,0)'`, which is fully opaque.
 * | StrokeThickness        | 2px            | `ctx.lineWidth` is hardcoded to `2`.
 * | Layout                 | spread         | Multiple lines are drawn with their start and end points chosen randomly, distributing them across the canvas.
 * | CenteredAt             | N/A            | This facet is not applicable to lines, which are defined by start and end points, not a center.
 * | EdgeAlignment          | not-crisp      | Lines are drawn at random (often oblique) angles, which inherently prevents crisp pixel grid alignment.
 * | Orientation            | random         | The line's orientation is determined by its two randomly selected endpoints, resulting in a random orientation.
 * | ArcAngleExtent         | N/A            | This facet is only applicable to arc shapes.
 * | RoundRectRadius        | N/A            | This facet is only applicable to rounded rectangle shapes.
 * | ContextTranslation     | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.translate()`.
 * | ContextRotation        | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.rotate()`.
 * | ContextScaling         | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.scale()`.
 * | Clipped on shape       | none           | The test code does not contain any calls to `ctx.clip()`.
 * | Clipped on shape count | n/a            | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape arrangement | n/a      | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape size  | n/a            | Clipping is not used in this test.
 * | Clipped on shape edge alignment | n/a   | Not applicable as there is no clipping.

 * UNCAPTURED ASPECTS IN FILENAME / FACETS ABOVE:
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * Line length is randomized from 0 to the canvas diagonal length, spanning multiple size categories (XS-XL). Position and orientation are randomized.

/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Test definition for rendering multiple (typically 20 for visual regression,
 * 'instances' count for performance) 2px thick, black, opaque stroke lines
 * at random positions and with random orientations.
 *
 * Guiding Principles for this draw function:
 * - General:
 *   - The function is designed to draw a variable number of lines.
 *   - `currentIterationNumber` is used to seed `SeededRandom` if drawing the 'initialCount'
 *     of lines (e.g., for visual regression tests where reproducibility of the scene is key).
 *     However, for the core logic of getting random points for lines, this function
 *     directly uses `SeededRandom.getRandom()` as per standard practice, assuming
 *     `RenderTest` handles initial seeding.
 * - `initialCount` Parameter:
 *   - This parameter defines the number of lines to draw for a standard visual test run.
 *   - It's passed to `runCanvasCode` by the `define_..._test` function.
 * - `instances` Parameter (for Performance Testing):
 *   - If `instances` is provided (not null and > 0), it signifies a performance test run.
 *   - The function will then draw 'instances' number of lines instead of 'initialCount'.
 *   - In this mode, logging is skipped, and `null` is returned.
 *   - `SeededRandom` is still used for coordinates to maintain the nature of the test,
 *     but the sheer number of operations is the focus.
 * - Return Value:
 *   - Returns an object with a `logs` array for single/initialCount runs.
 *   - Returns `null` if `instances` is set (performance mode) or if no logs are generated.
 *   - No `checkData` is returned as this test primarily focuses on rendering multiple
 *     lines without specific positional or color checks beyond visual comparison and
 *     performance measurement.
